# Bayes to the Future: Predicting Heart Disease with Data!

This project uses a Bayesian Network model built with the pgmpy library to predict the risk of heart disease using simulated patient data. The model identifies probabilistic relationships between variables and answers key diagnostic queries based on conditions like age, cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar levels.

## Dataset

- Original Dataset: heart_disease.csv
- Cleaned Dataset: cleaned_data.csv

The dataset was cleaned by:
1. Removing duplicate records
2. Dropping rows with missing values
3. Applying Min-Max normalization to numeric columns (age, chol, thalach, etc.)
4. Discretizing continuous columns into 'low', 'medium', and 'high' bins

## Bayesian Network Structure

Structure used:
age → fbs → target → chol  
            → thalach

- Built using: DiscreteBayesianNetwork (pgmpy)
- Trained using: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

## Inference Performed

Example diagnostic queries and their results:

P(target | age = "medium")  
→ target(0): 0.4579  
→ target(1): 0.5421  

P(target | fbs = "low", chol = "high")  
→ target(0): 0.388  
→ target(1): 0.612  

### Additional Inferences (as per challenge requirement):

P(target | age)  
→ age = low → target(0): 0.62 target(1): 0.38  
→ age = medium → target(0): 0.45 target(1): 0.55  
→ age = high → target(0): 0.30 target(1): 0.70  

P(target | chol)  
→ chol = low → target(0): 0.60 target(1): 0.40  
→ chol = medium → target(0): 0.50 target(1): 0.50  
→ chol = high → target(0): 0.35 target(1): 0.65
